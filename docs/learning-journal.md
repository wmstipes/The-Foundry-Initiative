### What I worked on

Created the initial structure and guiding documents for The Foundry Initiative.

### What I learned

A project can begin with structure and intent before its first technical implementation is selected.

### What was difficult

Starting something meaningful can create pressure to make it large or perfect immediately.

### What I finished

Established a repository scaffold, roadmap, project vision, contribution workflow, and architecture placeholder.

### Next small step

Choose a first artifact that can be completed and demonstrated in a short development cycle.

### What I worked on

Built SignalForge from an initial Raspberry Pi Kubernetes lab into a repeatable application and observability platform. The work progressed through Milestones 001-023 and culminated in Restaurant API `0.7.0` with lightweight Prometheus collection.

### What I learned

- Small milestones make a multi-component platform easier to build, test, and explain.
- A Kubernetes Service is useful for stable application access, but Prometheus should discover and scrape each replica directly when per-Pod counters matter.
- Application metrics and the Kubernetes Metrics API solve different problems; installing Prometheus does not make `kubectl top` available.
- Histogram buckets can be aggregated across replicas, making them appropriate for fleet-wide latency percentiles.
- Metric labels need the same design discipline as an API. Route templates and a bounded `unmatched` value prevent uncontrolled cardinality.
- Automated tests, manifest validation, pinned images, and operator helpers turn successful commands into a repeatable engineering workflow.
- Cross-platform quoting deserves explicit testing when PowerShell launches commands inside Linux containers.

### What was difficult

The most subtle problem was distinguishing a healthy metrics collector from broader cluster resource monitoring. Another challenge was correcting the Prometheus target-check helper after nested PowerShell and shell quoting produced an unterminated-string failure.

Release sequencing also required care: application changes, GitHub Actions, a version tag, the ARM64 image build, Kubernetes deployment, smoke tests, and Prometheus validation each had to complete in the right order.

### What I finished

- Deployed and operated a four-node Kubernetes cluster.
- Released Restaurant API `0.7.0` as three healthy replicas.
- Added application CI, ARM64 image publishing, versioned Kubernetes manifests, and validation automation.
- Added laptop-based deployment, smoke-test, status, log, and metrics helpers.
- Created and exercised an operator runbook.
- Deployed a least-privilege Prometheus collector with three healthy Pod targets.
- Added request latency, application-versus-synthetic traffic classification, and label-cardinality protection.
- Verified the live application, automatic target discovery, and baseline PromQL queries.

### Next small step

Select Milestone 024. Evaluate whether Kubernetes Metrics Server provides enough operational value to justify its footprint in the Raspberry Pi cluster.
