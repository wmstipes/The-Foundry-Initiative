# Forge YAML Workbench Kubernetes Manifests

These manifests define the deployed SignalForge browser-local Forge YAML Workbench.

## Resources

- `namespace.yaml` creates the restricted `forge-tools` namespace.
- `forge-yaml-workbench-deployment.yaml` runs one stateless, unprivileged NGINX replica on container port `8080`.
- `forge-yaml-workbench-service.yaml` provides lab access through NodePort `30081`.

## Image

Version:

```text
0.1.2
```

Immutable image reference:

```text
wmstipes/signalforge-yaml-workbench:0.1.2@sha256:07f34be33c55bca5b7bf5321e5d149e4831ce520c9efbdd98233468a1a50e3c7
```

The OCI image index contains both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. No floating image tag is used.

## Security and data boundaries

- The namespace enforces the Kubernetes restricted Pod Security Standard at v1.36.
- The Pod runs as non-root with runtime-default seccomp.
- Privilege escalation is disabled, all Linux capabilities are dropped, and the root filesystem is read-only.
- Only a bounded `emptyDir` at `/tmp` is writable.
- No ServiceAccount token is mounted and no Kubernetes API or RBAC access is granted.
- YAML analysis occurs in the browser. Pasted YAML is not sent to or stored by the NGINX container.

## Local validation

From the repository root:

```powershell
python .\scripts\validate-k8s-manifests.py
```

## Change review

Before any update, preview the exact resources against the live API without applying them:

```powershell
kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f .\k8s\forge-yaml-workbench\namespace.yaml
kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f .\k8s\forge-yaml-workbench\forge-yaml-workbench-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f .\k8s\forge-yaml-workbench\forge-yaml-workbench-service.yaml
kubectl diff -f .\k8s\forge-yaml-workbench
```

Do not apply a change until the dry-run and diff are reviewed and explicit approval is given.

After approval, apply only the reviewed resource and verify the rollout. For a Deployment-only image update:

```powershell
kubectl apply -f .\k8s\forge-yaml-workbench\forge-yaml-workbench-deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/forge-yaml-workbench -n forge-tools --timeout=180s
kubectl get deployment,pods,service -n forge-tools -o wide
```

The currently accepted live `0.1.1` deployment has one available Ready replica with zero restarts and a runtime ImageID matching its pinned OCI index digest. NodePort `30081`, `/healthz`, the application page, security headers, multi-document formatting, and flow-to-block formatting passed live acceptance. The `0.1.2` manifest is a deployment candidate until its separate dry-run, diff, approval, rollout, and live verification complete.
